# Vulnerability Scanning
Discovering and reporting vulnerabilities and security issues by scanning documents is a common process. If you are a security partner, when a new customer is onboarded, there can be hundreds of thousands of files to scan. Similarly, if a security procedure changes, previously scanned files may need to be rescanned. Scanning a large number of files is a both time consuming and expensive process. In this module, you will learn to scale a vulnerability scanning application to quickly and efficiently handle hundreds of thousands of files.
