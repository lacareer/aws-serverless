# Monte Carlo Simulation
A Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that allows us to predict different outcomes for various changes to a given system. In financial portfolio analysis the technique can be used to predict likely outcomes for aggregate portfolio across a range of potential conditions such as aggregate rate of return or default rate in various market conditions. The technique is also valuable in scenarios where your business case requires predicting the likely outcome of individual portfolio assets such detailed portfolio analysis or stress tests.
