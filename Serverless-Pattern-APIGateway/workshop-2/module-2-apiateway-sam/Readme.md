<!-- Module Goals -->
Use AWS SAM and OpenAPI to build the following API features:

- Create your first SAM project
- Define an API Gateway resource
- Define your API specification using a OpenAPI template
- Message Transformation
- Request Validation
- Authentication and Authorization
- Message Caching
- Usage plans and Message Throttling
- Export OpenAPI via Console

This module will guide you to build the API and its integration using AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)  and OpenAPI , but you can also develop your APIs using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) , or third-party Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools, like Terraform and Serverless Framework.

After you deploy the application with SAM and tested it, delete the stack before moving on to module 3. The copy the module-2/first-api to module-3/
